            <p class="AboutTitle">Our story</p>
            <p class="AboutText"><i>Dear Travelers, <br/> Having had the opportunity to experience professionally the increasing trend of online ferry booking and the complexity experienced by the user during the reservation process, one of our founding members turned to longtime collaborators and friends to brainstorm on an innovative approach for online ferry tickets sales. The brainstorming group grew larger as we turned to one another. A team of experts was formed with shipping, IT and statistical analysis skills with one vision: to design and provide a service that simplifies ferry booking, thus turning it into a unique experience.</i></p>

            <p class="AboutTitle">To Travel is to Live</p>
            <p class="AboutText">Andersen once wrote, "At rejse er at leve" (to travel is to live) and we guess you are already aware of his famous quote. What you probably donâ€™t know is that Andersen came to this conclusion after fulfilling numerous travels from one country to another by ferry. Travelling was for him a natural way of living. We totally agree with him and we urge you to embrace it. We travel to learn, to see, to explore, to meet, to taste. We travel to feel free and happy. Let us make your sea-travels an amazing experience!</p>
